As a seasoned Senior Software Engineer and technical writer, I'd like you to review our existing Git repository and draft a comprehensive, high-quality README file that accurately reflects the current state of the project. The README should provide a clear overview of the repository's contents, including a detailed description of the software application or system being developed, its primary features and functionality, as well as any notable dependencies or third-party integrations.
The README should also include instructions on how to install, configure, and run the software locally, along with any prerequisites or system requirements. Additionally, you should outline the project structure, file organization, and coding conventions followed in the repository, highlighting any key design patterns, architectural decisions, or implementation details.
